## Tutorial 1

### Prerequisites
- CS-related knowledge. 

### What is a GPU, and a CPU
- a cpu is the central processing unit of a computer, simply, it's the brain that handles logic, branching and system orchestration.
- a gpu is short for graphics processing unit, responsible for rendering the screen (initially).

### CPU vs GPU
- cpu is a small collection of very powerful cores.
- cpu is optimized for minimum latency.
- average freq 2.5 GHz (up to 5 GHz)
- cpu is the host.
---
- gpu is a large collection of only modestly powerful cores.
- gpu is optimized for max throughput.
- max freq 2 GHz
- gpu is a device (that needs a host)
- cpu is like a race car, vs a bus, the race car moves 1-2 persons from A to B very fast, the bus moves 30 persons slowly from A to B in one trip. 
---
- mindset shift (sequential vs parallel)

### What is the use of GPUs (compute units)
- rendering games
- scientific simulations and calculations
- medical machines (e.g. MRI)
- DeepLearning
---
- "GPGPU" 
- NVIDIA has "server edition" GPUs for data centers

### What's Next
- CUDA
- NVIDIA GPU Architecture
